# Shifterator Analysis of Spotify app ratings and reviews

Here I had compared 1-star reviews and 5-star reviews and how they generally differ based on the words alone.



Based from the charts above, we can guess how both lists differ from one another.

1. Five-star reviews:
- Easy use of the application
- Having good quality and good experience on using the app

2. One-star reviews:
- Some technical errors - not able to play the music
- asking the developer team to fix the app
